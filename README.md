## Project Description

The project involves the kinematic and dynamic analysis of a mechanical arm, with a focus on:

1. **Kinematic Analysis:** Calculation of the angular velocity, angular acceleration, and linear motion of the arm's segments.
2. **Dynamic Analysis:** Determination of the forces and torques required for the arm's movement, including the effects of carrying an additional load.
3. **Motor Actuation:** Analysis of the motor's performance characteristics, including torque-speed curves and power consumption.
4. **Vibration Analysis:** Examination of the arm's vibrational behavior and the impact of different input forces.

The project includes a detailed MATLAB implementation for solving the mechanical problems and generating relevant plots.

## Key Features

- **MATLAB Simulations:** Scripts to simulate the mechanical arm's movement and analyze its dynamic behavior.
- **Plot Generation:** Automatic generation of plots for position, velocity, acceleration, and dynamic responses.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Includes kinematic, dynamic, motor actuation, and vibration analyses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2020b or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biomedical-engineering-mechanical-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd biomedical-engineering-mechanical-project
   ```

3. Open the MATLAB project file or directly run the scripts.

## Usage

### Running the Simulations

To run the simulations:

1. Open the MATLAB scripts located in the `src/` directory.
2. Execute the script to perform the kinematic or dynamic analysis:

   ```matlab
   run('kinematic_analysis.m')
   ```

   or

   ```matlab
   run('dynamic_analysis.m')
   ```

### Generating Plots

The scripts automatically generate plots for the analyzed parameters. These plots can be viewed in the MATLAB figure window or saved as image files.

## Results

The results section includes:

- **Kinematic Results:** Angular velocities and accelerations of the arm's components.
- **Dynamic Results:** Required motor torque and forces acting on the arm.
- **Vibration Analysis:** Frequency response and transfer functions for input forces.
- **Motor Performance:** Torque-speed characteristics and power consumption.

Detailed results are provided in the `Report Progetto.pdf`.
